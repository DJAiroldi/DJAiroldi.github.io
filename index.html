      <p class="me">Hello! My name is Daniel J Airoldi. I am an 18 year old senior at Center for Technology Essex and Essex High School, currently living in Essex Vermont. I am a beginning 3d artist and animator, and have a passion for indie games. I have a
        dream to be able to develop my own indie games, and puzzle people with complexe lore similar to what has captivated me with the games I am invested in.</p>
      <p class="me">I am currently working on models simply for the fun of it using Blender, so that way once I am required to make characters for a future game, like the one I will be making in class during the second semester. My current specialty is mainly
        making robots, typically FNAF style animatronics. I am going to broaden my horizons once I have less time to focus on normal school work. You'll be able to see some of the things ive been working on, some fun facts about me and my work, as
        well as my resume.</p>
