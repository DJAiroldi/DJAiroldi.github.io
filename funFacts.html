    <p class="Fun"> My Main interests mainly lead back to when I used to live in St.Albans, Vermont. I was going into the fourth grade, and about 3 or 4 months in, This new kid shows up, and the two of us become friends after about a week. During The later half of 2014, he, and many others around the school were starting to get invested in this new horror game that had been realsed back in August, Five Nights at Freddy's. The series of games that followed were a major source of motivation in my future creations. However, I was unable to make anything beside the occasional drawing. But during 2020, which was force to be a hybrid learning year, was where I learn my first set of skills in 3d modeling. During the later months, as the focus in class shifted away from 3d modeling and animation, I began to start practicing on my own time. The Majority of my following creation that followed were mainly Fnaf style animatronics, and when I showed them off in class, they were so used to seeing something of mine in that style, that my teacher had asked me to try a different style. While I have been improving since then, I still have a little ways to go. </p>
